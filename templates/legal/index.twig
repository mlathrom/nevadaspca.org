          2. Legal bases for processing
        </h3>
        <p>
          We will process your personal information lawfully, fairly and in a
          transparent manner. We collect and process information about you only
          where we have legal bases for doing so.
        </p>
        <p>
          These legal bases depend on the services you use and how you use them,
          meaning we collect and use your information only where:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            it’s necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a
            party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a
            contract (for example, when we provide a service you request from
            us);
          </li>
          <li>
            it satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your
            data protection interests), such as for research and development, to
            market and promote our services, and to protect our legal rights and
            interests;
          </li>
          <li>

            we need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Where you consent to our use of information about you for a specific
          purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time (but this
          will not affect any processing that has already taken place).
        </p>
        <p>
          We don’t keep personal information for longer than is necessary. While
          we retain this information, we will protect it within commercially

          5. International transfers of personal information
        </h3>
        <p>
          The personal information we collect is stored and processed in United
          States, or where we or our partners, affiliates and third-party
          providers maintain facilities. By providing us with your personal
          information, you consent to the disclosure to these overseas third
          parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will ensure that any transfer of personal information from
          countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) to countries outside the
          EEA will be protected by appropriate safeguards, for example by using
          standard data protection clauses approved by the European Commission,
          or the use of binding corporate rules or other legally accepted means.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where we transfer personal information from a non-EEA country to
          another country, you acknowledge that third parties in other
          jurisdictions may not be subject to similar data protection laws to
          the ones in our jurisdiction. There are risks if any such third party
          engages in any act or practice that would contravene the data privacy
          laws in our jurisdiction and this might mean that you will not be able
          to seek redress under our jurisdiction’s privacy laws.

          Fair Use
        </h2>
        <p>
          Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use
          of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or
          phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for
          purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching
          (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or
          research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether
          the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the
          factors to be considered shall include—
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is
            of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
          </li>
          <li>the nature of the copyrighted work;</li>
          <li>
            the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the
            copyrighted work as a whole; and
          </li>
          <li>
            the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the
            copyrighted work.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of
          fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above
          factors.
